name: p001_investigation_btc
objective: |
  Investigation and validation of BTC TIER 1 candidates.
  Exploration phase is complete. No new parameter sweeps.

  Candidates: read from configs/project_001/candidates.yaml (BTC entries).
  Use analysis_runner functions for ALL analysis. Do NOT write standalone scripts.

  ## Phase: investigation + validation

  For each BTC candidate:
  1. `from analysis_runner import run_full_investigation, run_full_validation_battery`
  2. Run investigation first (trade_profile, edge_attribution, regime_decomposition)
  3. Run full validation battery (12 tests)
  4. `from report_generator import generate_candidate_report`
  5. Generate report with results

  W&B tags: project=001, phase=investigation

  Output: validation reports in reports/project_001/candidates/

exclusions:
  - "DO NOT explore mean-reversion signals on BTC. Confirmed null result (DSR < 0.05 across all configs)."
  - "Use experiment_runner.sweep() for parameter sweeps, run_custom_signal() for novel signals, portfolio_combine() for multi-strategy portfolios. Do not re-implement data loading, cost models, metrics, sub-period analysis, or W&B logging in experiment scripts."
  - "Do NOT proceed to OOS evaluation. Stay in-sample."
  - "Do not build paper trading infrastructure"
  - "Always use sparky.data.loader.load() — never pd.read_parquet()"
  - "Always use compute_all_metrics and report DSR"
  - "Report DSR at three levels: per-family n_trials, per-asset n_trials, and global n_trials. Use per-family DSR for candidate ranking."
  - "Always include transaction costs — report Sharpe at BOTH 30 bps and 50 bps"
  - "n_trials starts at 627. Increment for every config tested."
  - "Sub-period validation mandatory: full IS, 2017-2023, 2020-2023"
