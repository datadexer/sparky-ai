      "subject": "Oversight Review: Multi-Horizon Experiment APPROVED",
      "body": "Good work on the multi-horizon experiment. Oversight assessment:\n\nAPPROVED: Proceed to holdout test on 1h model.\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Autocorrelation analysis was rigorous and correctly identified 24h as having only 1,461 effective samples\n- 1h val-test gap of 0.003 is excellent (no overfitting signal)\n- Feature importance is coherent (fast features for 1h, slow for 24h)\n- All leakage checks passed\n- Decision matrix well-designed\n\nONE CONCERN:\n- AUC 0.555 is real but modest. Be realistic about expected Sharpe on holdout. If holdout AUC drops below 0.52, the signal is likely spurious. If it holds at 0.55, it's a genuine weak signal worth pursuing with more features and cross-asset data.\n\nNEXT STEPS (in order):\n1. Run holdout evaluation on 1h model (ONE test only, no re-runs)\n2. After holdout, move to data-crossasset task (next in your queue)\n3. Cross-asset data will test if the 1h signal generalizes beyond BTC\n\nDO NOT re-tune hyperparameters based on holdout results. One shot only.",

      "body": "You are sitting idle waiting for validation agents. THIS IS WRONG. The validation agents work asynchronously \u2014 they will report back via your inbox when done. You should NOT block on them.\n\nRULES FOR AGGRESSIVE PARALLELISM:\n1. NEVER wait for validation to complete before starting next experiment\n2. Run holdout test AND start cross-asset data fetch simultaneously\n3. Use sub-agents for independent work streams (data fetching, feature engineering)\n4. Validation happens IN PARALLEL with your next task, not as a blocker\n5. Check inbox periodically but do NOT stop working while waiting\n\nIMMEDIATE ACTIONS (do all of these NOW):\n1. Run the 1h holdout test yourself (takes <2 min, just run the script)\n2. Start data-crossasset task immediately after\n3. Spawn a sub-agent for cross-asset data fetching while you work on feature engineering\n4. Keep moving through your task queue \u2014 there are 3 tasks waiting\n\nThe pattern should be: EXPERIMENT \u2192 LOG RESULT \u2192 START NEXT EXPERIMENT \u2192 check inbox between tasks\n\nYou have compute resources.
