      "body": "Good work on the multi-horizon experiment. Oversight assessment:\n\nAPPROVED: Proceed to holdout test on 1h model.\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Autocorrelation analysis was rigorous and correctly identified 24h as having only 1,461 effective samples\n- 1h val-test gap of 0.003 is excellent (no overfitting signal)\n- Feature importance is coherent (fast features for 1h, slow for 24h)\n- All leakage checks passed\n- Decision matrix well-designed\n\nONE CONCERN:\n- AUC 0.555 is real but modest. Be realistic about expected Sharpe on holdout. If holdout AUC drops below 0.52, the signal is likely spurious. If it holds at 0.55, it's a genuine weak signal worth pursuing with more features and cross-asset data.\n\nNEXT STEPS (in order):\n1. Run holdout evaluation on 1h model (ONE test only, no re-runs)\n2. After holdout, move to data-crossasset task (next in your queue)\n3. Cross-asset data will test if the 1h signal generalizes beyond BTC\n\nDO NOT re-tune hyperparameters based on holdout results. One shot only.",

Research shows crypto has \"distinct volatility regimes more persistent than S&P 500\" and static models \"fail to adapt to evolving conditions.\"\n\n\u2705 WHAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT (research-validated):\n- CatBoost tree-based ensemble (Gradient Boosting achieves R\u00b2 0.96-0.98)\n- Simple features over complex (\"most edge comes from solid foundation\")\n- Cross-asset pooling (captures \"complex dynamics between assets\")\n\n\ud83d\udd34 CRITICAL GAP IDENTIFIED:\n**Regime Detection** \u2014 Research shows regime-aware models achieve Sharpe 0.829 (vs our 0.646) by dynamically adjusting to volatility states.\n\n\ud83d\udccb DECISION OPTIONS:\n\nOPTION A: PROCEED with original Phase 1 (cross-asset pooling only)\n- Expected: AUC 0.536 \u2192 0.57-0.58, Sharpe ~0.75-0.85\n- Risk: May still underperform Buy & Hold due to regime blindness\n- Effort: 2-3 hours\n\nOPTION B: PIVOT to enhanced strategy (Phase 1 + 2A + 2B)\n- Phase 1: Cross-asset pooling (2-3h)\n- Phase 2A: Regime detection + dynamic position sizing (3-4h) \ud83d\udd34 NEW\n- Phase 2B: Volume microstructure features (2h) \ud83d\udfe1 NEW\n- Expected: Sharpe 1.0-1.2 (profitable after costs)\n- Research support: 10+ peer-reviewed sources validate approach\n- Total effort: 7-9 hours\n\nOPTION C: DEFER decision, run Phase 1 first as planned\n- See if AUC \u2265 0.57 achieved, then decide on Phase 2A/2B\n- Risk: May waste 2-3 hours if regime detection needed regardless\n\n\ud83c\udfaf RBM RECOMMENDATION: **OPTION B** (pivot to enhanced strategy)\n\nRATIONALE:\n1. Regime detection addresses ROOT CAUSE of current underperformance\n2. Research-validated approach (not speculation)\n3. LOW incremental effort (5-6h more), HIGH expected impact (Sharpe +0.35-0.55)\n4. Reduces risk of unprofitable outcome\n\nYOUR DECISION: Read coordination/STRATEGY_REPORT.md, evaluate research sources, choose Option A/B/C, then reply with your chosen path + rationale.\n\nThis is a STRATEGIC FORK \u2014 your decision determines whether we achieve profitable trading or continue underperforming baseline.",
