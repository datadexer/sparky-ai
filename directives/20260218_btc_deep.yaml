objective: |
  Deep exploration of BTC signal strategies at underexplored timeframes.
  Focus on robustness validation and filling gaps in the parameter space.

  Benchmark: BTC Don4h(30,25) flat Sharpe 1.702@30bps, DSR 0.991.
  Validated best: BTC Don8h(40,10) iv(vw30,tv0.2) Sharpe 2.045@30bps.

  Use experiment_runner.run() for all evaluations. Do NOT re-implement signals.

  ## Daytime priorities (2026-02-19)

  **Priority 0 — Deepen Don8h**: entry 35-55, exit 8-18, iv(vw30,tv0.2).
  Map the full robustness region.

  **Priority 0 — Year-by-year 2020+**: Top 5 BTC configs year-by-year breakdown
  2020, 2021, 2022, 2023. Report structural analysis.

  **Priority 1 — Don4h with inv_vol**: entry 80-160, exit 15-40,
  iv(vw=20-45, tv=0.15-0.30). Large grid to find BTC 4h optimum.

  **Priority 2 — Cost degradation**: Top 3 at 100bps. Report survival.

  Output: ranked table by DSR with Sharpe@30, Sharpe@50, MaxDD, sub-periods,
  n_trades(2020+), and neighbor stability analysis for top configs.

exclusions:
  - "DO NOT explore mean-reversion signals on BTC. Confirmed null result (DSR < 0.05 across all configs)."
  - "Use experiment_runner.sweep() for parameter sweeps, run_custom_signal() for novel signals, portfolio_combine() for ALL portfolio construction including cross-timeframe and cross-asset. portfolio_combine() now auto-detects the correct ppy for mixed-timeframe portfolios. Do NOT manually combine returns with index.intersection() and compute metrics — this bypasses the PPY guard and produces inflated Sharpe. When computing metrics on any returns series, ALWAYS pass a pandas Series with DatetimeIndex to compute_all_metrics(). NEVER call .values before passing to metrics functions."
  - "Do NOT proceed to OOS evaluation. Stay in-sample."
  - "Do not build paper trading infrastructure"
  - "Always use sparky.data.loader.load() — never pd.read_parquet()"
  - "Always use compute_all_metrics and report DSR"
  - "Report DSR at three levels: per-family n_trials, per-asset n_trials, and global n_trials. Use per-family DSR for candidate ranking."
  - "Always include transaction costs — report Sharpe at BOTH 30 bps and 50 bps"
  - "n_trials starts at 627. Increment for every config tested."
  - "Sub-period validation mandatory: full IS, 2017-2023, 2020-2023"
  - "Minimum 30 trades on the 2020-2023 sub-period"
  - "Compare every result against BTC Don4h(30,25) flat benchmark (Sharpe 1.702)"
  - "periods_per_year: 4380 (2h), 2190 (4h), 1095 (8h). Never use 252 or 365 for intraday."
