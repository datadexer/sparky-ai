objective: |
  Deep exploration of BTC signal strategies at underexplored timeframes.
  Focus on robustness validation and filling gaps in the parameter space.

  Benchmark: BTC Don4h(30,25) flat Sharpe 1.702@30bps, DSR 0.991.
  Key result needing validation: BTC_Don2h(80,40) Sharpe 1.819 — is this
  a local optimum or part of a robust region?

  Use experiment_runner.run() for all evaluations. Do NOT re-implement signals.

  Priority order:
  1. btc_donchian_2h_robustness — neighbor validation around (80,40).
     Also: all 2h inv-vol results need re-validation after sizing fix.
  2. btc_bollinger_2h — completely untested on BTC 2h.
  3. btc_donchian_8h_deep — lightly explored, partial diversifier.

  Output: ranked table by DSR with Sharpe@30, Sharpe@50, MaxDD, sub-periods,
  n_trades(2020+), and neighbor stability analysis for top configs.

      BTC_Don2h(80,40) scored Sharpe 1.819. Sweep neighbors to validate:
      entry 60-100, exit 30-50. Test flat + inverse_vol (with corrected ppy).
      Report whether the (80,40) region is robust or isolated.

exclusions:
  - "DO NOT explore mean-reversion signals on BTC. Confirmed null result (DSR < 0.05 across all configs)."
  - "Use experiment_runner.run() for all signal evaluations. Do not re-implement signal or cost logic."
  - "Do not evaluate on OOS data (boundary in configs/holdout_policy.yaml)"
  - "Do not build paper trading infrastructure"
  - "Always use sparky.data.loader.load() — never pd.read_parquet()"
  - "Always use compute_all_metrics and report DSR"
  - "Report DSR at three levels: per-family n_trials, per-asset n_trials, and global n_trials. Use per-family DSR for candidate ranking."
  - "Always include transaction costs — report Sharpe at BOTH 30 bps and 50 bps"
  - "n_trials starts at 627. Increment for every config tested."
  - "Sub-period validation mandatory: full IS, 2017-2023, 2020-2023"

  - "If your signal type isn't supported by experiment_runner, extend _make_signal() with a new dispatch case and document it."
