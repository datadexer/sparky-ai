name: baseline_reconciliation
objective: |
  Establish a canonical Donchian baseline with correct and consistent methodology,
  then reconcile all prior Sharpe claims.

  Context: The documented Single-TF Donchian(40/20) baseline was Sharpe 1.243, but
  current runs show 1.607. The gap is explained by three factors:
    1. Annualization changed from sqrt(252) to sqrt(365) (+20.4%) — this is CORRECT
    2. Costs changed: original used 26 bps total (TransactionCostModel.for_btc()),
       current uses 10 bps round-trip. Need to standardize.
    3. Method: original was mean of 5 yearly walk-forward Sharpes, current is
       full-period single Sharpe. Walk-forward is more conservative and correct.

  Tasks:
    1. Cost model: standard 30 bps per side, stress test 50 bps per side.
    2. Compute the canonical baseline at BOTH cost levels using: sqrt(365),
       walk-forward (yearly) mean Sharpe, with bootstrap CI and DSR.
    3. Update the regime_donchian directive's baseline reference number.
    4. Log the canonical baseline to wandb as a reference run.

  Success = a single, well-documented baseline Sharpe number with full methodology
  documented, logged to wandb, that all future comparisons reference.
