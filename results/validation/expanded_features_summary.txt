================================================================================

YEAR-BY-YEAR RESULTS:
  2019: Sharpe  2.00, Acc 56.7%, MaxDD -22.7%, WinRate 40.7%, Trades 107
  2020: Sharpe  3.55, Acc 60.0%, MaxDD -17.6%, WinRate 43.7%, Trades 100
  2021: Sharpe  0.56, Acc 50.4%, MaxDD -45.2%, WinRate 30.8%, Trades 110
  2022: Sharpe -1.84, Acc 49.3%, MaxDD -68.3%, WinRate 26.4%, Trades 119
  2023: Sharpe  1.69, Acc 51.0%, MaxDD -25.1%, WinRate 36.5%, Trades  96

AGGREGATE METRICS:
  Mean Sharpe:  1.194 ± 2.003
  Mean Acc:     53.5%
  Mean MaxDD:   -35.8%
  Mean WinRate: 35.6%

STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE:
  Bootstrap 95% CI: [-0.17, 2.53]
  Donchian baseline: 1.062
  ⚠ Lower bound below baseline — NOT statistically significant

ASSESSMENT: TIER 3 (NOT TIER 2)
- Mean Sharpe 1.19 > baseline 1.06 (+13%)
- BUT: High variance (±2.0) and wide CI
- 2022 bear market: -1.84 Sharpe (catastrophic)
- Only 2 of 5 years beat baseline individually (2019, 2020)
- Fails statistical significance test

CONCLUSION:
- Feature expansion shows promise (1.19 vs 0.98 on 58 features)
- BUT: Not robust enough for TIER 2 paper trading
- High drawdowns (-68% in 2022) unacceptable for live capital
- Continue iterating: try ensemble methods, different lookback windows, regime filtering

NEXT STEPS:
1. Investigate 2022 failure mode (bear market regime)
2. Try regime-conditional models (bull/bear separate)
3. Ensemble top 3 configs to reduce variance
4. Extend validation to 2024 (currently stopped at 2023)
